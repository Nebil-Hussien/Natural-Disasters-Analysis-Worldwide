This function loads data from a specified file path and returns it as a DataFrame.,Data Preparation,file_path (str): Path to the Excel file,data (DataFrame),The function reads an Excel file using pd.read_excel. It handles UnicodeDecodeError for incorrect file types.
"This function preprocesses the data by loading it and then dropping specific columns, returning a clean DataFrame.",Data Preparation,file_path (str): Path to the Excel file,clean_data (DataFrame),"The function calls load_data to get the data, then drops specified columns using data.drop. It handles cases where data might be empty."
This function cleans the data by filling missing values and converting columns to categorical type.,Data Preparation,data (DataFrame),cleaned_data (DataFrame),The function fills missing values with 0 and converts specific columns to the 'category' type.
"This function describes the data, providing descriptive statistics and frequency counts.",Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),description (str),The function uses pandas' describe method for descriptive statistics and value_counts for frequency counts.
This function plots the administrative responses to disasters.,Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),plot (Figure),The function uses matplotlib and seaborn to plot administrative responses.
This function compares the data by region and generates comparison plots.,Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),comparison_plot (Figure),The function uses pandas and matplotlib to create region comparison plots.
This function performs a t-test for administrative responses and returns the results.,Data Analysis,"data (DataFrame), responses (list)",t_test_results (dict),The function performs t-tests using scipy.stats.ttest_ind and returns the results.
This function performs a simplified regression analysis on the data and returns the model summary.,Data Analysis,"data (DataFrame), features (list), target_variable (str)",regression_summary (str),The function performs linear regression using statsmodels and returns the model summary.
This function plots the total affected over years using matplotlib and prints the data in a table.,Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),plot (Figure),"The function aggregates data by 'Start Year' and 'Total Affected', creates a bar plot and scatter plot, and prints a table of the aggregated data."
This function plots the number of injured and deaths over years using a line plot with markers and prints the data in a table.,Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),plot (Figure),"The function aggregates data by 'Start Year', plots injuries and deaths using line plots with markers, and prints tables for injuries and deaths data."
This function plots the total fatalities by disaster type using a grouped bar chart.,Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),plot (Figure),"The function aggregates data by 'Disaster Type' and 'Total Deaths', creates a grouped bar chart, and prints a table of the aggregated data."
The function calculates the changes in frequency of natural disaster types over the past specified number of years.,Data Analysis,"data (DataFrame), years_past (int)",changes_df (DataFrame),"The function converts 'Start Year' to datetime, filters data for the past and recent years, calculates the average frequency per year for each period, and returns a DataFrame showing the increase or decrease in frequency of each natural disaster type."
The function create a choropleth map showing the number of specific disaster types by country. ,Data Analysis,"data (DataFrame), disaster_type (str), title (str), colorscale (str)",plot (Figure),"The function aggregates the data by country, filters for the specific disaster type, and uses px.choropleth to generate the map."
The function plots the trend of a specified disaster type over time.,Data Analysis,"data (DataFrame), disaster_type (str)",plot (Figure),"The fuction converts 'Start Year' to datetime, filters data for the specified disaster type, aggregates data by year, and uses matplotlib to plot the trend."
The function plots an animated geographical scatter plot of earthquakes with magnitude 6.5 or greater over the past 20 years.,Data Analysis,data (DataFrame),plot (Figure),"The function filters the data, prepares it for animation, and uses Plotly to create the animated map."
